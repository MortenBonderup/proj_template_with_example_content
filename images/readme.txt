Remember to avoid illegal characters in filename: Spaces, /*$@%æøå and others 
Give your images meaningful file names i.e. use the file name to describe the image.
Also, prepare the image for web use - compress it so that the file size
matches the image size on the webpage: If you need small images, the image file size
should be small, if you need an image with large dimensions on the webpage, it 
is okay that the file size is large (but still optimized for web).
